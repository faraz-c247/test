- **Component Structure**: Logical file organization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Code Quality Issues**

**Inconsistent Error Handling:**
- Mixed error handling patterns across components
- Some functions throw errors, others return null
- No standardized error types or error boundaries

**Mixed State Management:**
- Some components use local state where global state would be more appropriate
- Inconsistent data fetching patterns between components

#### 2. **Performance Concerns**

**Large Bundle Size:**
- Homepage component is 1094 lines (40KB) - should be split
- Multiple large components that could benefit from code splitting
- No lazy loading for route components

**Memory Leaks:**
- Potential memory leaks in JWT blacklist management
- Event listeners not properly cleaned up in some components

#### 3. **Security Considerations**

**Token Storage:**
- Multiple token storage locations (localStorage, sessionStorage, NextAuth session)
- No single source of truth for token management
- Sensitive data stored in localStorage

**Input Validation:**
- Client-side validation only (Yup schemas)
- No server-side validation verification
- Potential XSS vulnerabilities in user-generated content

#### 4. **Production Readiness**

**Environment Configuration:**
- Missing production environment variables
- No environment-specific configurations
- Hardcoded URLs in some places

**Error Monitoring:**
- No error tracking service integration
- Limited error logging and monitoring
- No performance monitoring
